# kissui

Simple, easy-to-use and modern user-interface framework. 

## Philosophy 

> Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler.
> [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)

We believe this world is full of sophisticated things and as the time goes by, it is getting more and more complicated. Thus, we created this repository to make developers' life much simpler.  

The [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

**kissui** or **kiss ui** is a HTML5 and CSS3 framework for desktop and mobile to make a beautiful and simple user-interface. It is free(and will be free) and it is based on [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton).
