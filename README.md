### Philosophy 

> Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler.
> [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)

We believe this world is full of sophisticated things and as the time goes by, it is getting more and more complicated. Thus, we created this repository to make developers' life much simpler.  

The [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

**Kissui** or **Kiss ui** (KISS stands for *Keep it simple, stupid*) is a HTML5 and CSS3 framework for desktop and mobile to make a beautiful and simple user-interface. It is free(and will be free) and it is based on [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton).   

The first objective of **Kissui** is to the life easier for web/mobile developers and their users.

### Key features

- Simple, lightweight and easy to use
- Responsive. Ready for developing web, mobile and  desktop apps
- Retina display ready
- Free and open-source

...and alive.
